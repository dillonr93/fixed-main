# 1.0.3
- reduce the dart minimum version from 2.14 to 2.12
- formatting

# 1.0.2
- Fixed a bug in Fixed.copyWith where if the scale wasn't passed the existing scale wasn't retained.

# 1.0.1
- spelling grammar and formatting.

# 1.0.1
 - change Fixed() to Fixed.copyWith


# 1.0.0-beta4
- Renamed Fixed.from to Fixed.fromNum for consistency with other ctor names. 
- Fixed.fromNum now throws an AmountTooLargeException. 
- Fixed.fromMinorUnits has been renamed Fixed.fromInt
- Added tests for rescaling and rounding when rescaling.
- change rescale to round rather than truncate as the truncation was causing unexpected results (e.g. rounding errors).
- fix issue with decimal without precision

# 1.0.0-beta3
- changes the underlying implementation to use the decimal package
  Thanks to Alexandre Ardhuin for the significant contribution that made this possible :)
- Created statics for one, two and zero. Created consts for maxInt and minInt. Added ~/, %, remainder, abs, sign, pow, toInt
- change thousandSeparator to groupSeparator as this is the more generally used term
- Changed Fixed.fromBigInt to take minor units rather than major units as I found I was constantly misusing it. I think actually makes more sense you can always BigInt.toInt and Fixed.from to create a fixed from a BigInt.
- Fixed the formatter for small -ve numbers. Added a 'decimalPart' method to return just the decimal component of the fixed no. Renamed majorUnits to 'integerPart'

# 1.0.0-beta2
Improved the documentation.

# 1.0.0-beta1
First release of Fixed.
